# Telecom-customer-churn-preduction-<br>
### Project Description<br>
The Telecom Customer Churn Predictor is a data science project
aimed at predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. 
Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project utilizes logistic 
regression to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, providing 
valuable insights for retention strategies. The project also includes 
data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the dataset, 
feature importance analysis, and predictive analysis.<br>

### Dataset Used<br>
The project uses WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv for analysis. The dataset contains customer data such as CustomerID, Gender, Senior citizen, partner, dependent, tenure, phone service, Multiplelines, internet service, online security, online backup, Device protection, Tech support, streaming Tv, streaminovies, contract, paperless, payment method, monthly charges, total charges, churn.<br>
### Result Obtained<br>
After training the model, the project achieved an accuracy of 76% on the test dataset.<br>
